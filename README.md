Your challenge is to build out this 2-page coming soon website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See error states when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The Name and/or Email Address fields are empty
  - The Email Address is not formatted correctly
- Bonus: See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second
- Bonus: See a custom-styled select form control in the sign-up form

Download the project and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project and help you get set up.
